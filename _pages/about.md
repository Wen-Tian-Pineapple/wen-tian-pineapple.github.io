I am genuinely interested in VLSI, computer architecture, hardware microarchitecture and algorithm-hardware co-design research. Currently, I work in the industry focused on RISC-V server CPU microarchitecture while simultaneously conducting part-time research in the field of computer architecture. Additionally, I had some project experience regarding efficient microarchitecture design(neural network accelerator) & software-hardware co-design(reinforcement learning EDA tool). 

I got my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (VLSI track) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor [UofM](https://umich.edu/). I got my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at University of California San Diego [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, basketball, video gaming and chatting with people.
