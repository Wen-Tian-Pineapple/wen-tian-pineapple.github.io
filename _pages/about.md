I am genuinely interested in machine learning, computer architecture/microarchitecture and algorithm-hardware co-design research. Currently, I am working in the industry focus on RISC-V server CPU microarchitecture. Additionally, I had project experience regarding efficient npu microarchitecture(neural network accelerator), in-memory vector computing and algorithm-hardware co-design(reinforcement learning EDA tool). 

I got my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (VLSI track) at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) and my Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, basketball, video gaming and chatting with people.
